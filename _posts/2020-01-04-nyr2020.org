So... new day/ week/ month/ year/ decade, new me? Since writing down resolutions may help one to be more driven or motivate others, here are mine:

*** Table of Contents :TOC_7:
    - [[#resolution-1][Resolution 1]]
    - [[#resolution-2][Resolution 2]]
    - [[#resolution-3][Resolution 3]]
    - [[#resolution-4][Resolution 4]]
    - [[#resolution-5][Resolution 5]]
    - [[#end-note][End Note]]

*** Resolution 1
Use more [[https://magit.vc/][magit]]. I've heard quite a lot of testimonials. I also found [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCMh7srOqvw&list=PLhXZp00uXBk4np17N39WvB80zgxlZfVwj][this series]], where the last three videos go over magit. I find Zaiste's voice to be very nice as well, so I'll hopefully take in the information instead of falling asleep or impatiently waiting for the videos to end.

*** Resolution 2
Work out a bit! Doesn't have to be a full on gym session... I'm thinking about just a routine to keep me active. One of my favorite quotes is:

#+begin_quote
A sound soul dwells within a sound mind and a sound body.
#+end_quote

#+BEGIN_CENTER
Atsushi ÅŒkubo, Soul Eater
#+END_CENTER

*** Resolution 3
Read a bit more. Refer to the quote above! Thinking about a few good fiction books to get back in the groove of physical text (sometimes it's good to move away from technology and unwind).

*** Resolution 4
Languages... I was super invested before, but somehow I've stopped. I didn't even realize it until this post. I hope to try and figure out some basics again, feels like I've forgotten all I learned.

*** Resolution 5
Try to keep posting!

*** End Note
These goals seem easy enough, and hopefully they won't just become habit, but they'll evolve to become.
