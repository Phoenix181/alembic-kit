You may be wondering what the text above is. Due to limitations of information  and communication mediums, I ended up trying to learn a bunch of languages. I could be called a 'jack of languages' since I'm sadly not a 'master of languages' (most of what I know is super basic). On my small journey, Japanese was a fun language language that still remains mostly foreign to me. Still, some sites use hiragana which I sort of understand and so I decided to include some Japanese to pay homage to the voyage. 'クリック コード サイクル！' roughly translates to 'Click, Code, Cycle!'.
