=Potential of use-package-ensure-system-package= is quite a long title as opposed to the actual post. A lot of {% include emoji/emacs.html %}-ers use =use-package= for clean and sane configurations, which is great. However, not many look over its code and realize it could be made... better. We'll go over my foresight of a specific hook today: =ensure-system-package=.

*** Note
Just as a precautionary note, in no way should this post be construed as a critique of /anyone/. This is more of a call to action or a status report of what I've been up to lately. I appreciate everyone who has/ will contribute/ use to the package or is just reading this post.
